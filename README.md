# GUESS THE WORD

`WEBSITE:` https://guess-the-word.surge.sh/

## `INTRODUCTION`

This is my latest personal project. It took me more than 1 week to complete (October 30 to November 7). To complete this project, I used a combination of `ReactJS`, `TypeScript` and `Redux` along with `SCSS` to design the interface of this project. Although this is just a simple puzzle game website, it will be very effective in learning more unique English vocabulary with a vocabulary list of more than 5000 words that I have collected on the internet.

## `HOW TO PLAY`
### Guess the Word in 6 tries.

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

- The color of the tiles will change to show how close your
guess was to the word.
